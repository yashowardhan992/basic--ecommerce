# Ecommerce Project Description and Tech Stack

## Project Name: ecom

### Description
This e-commerce project is designed to provide users with a seamless online shopping experience. It allows customers to browse through a wide range of products, add items to their cart, and complete the purchase process. While the project does not include authentication features, it serves as a foundation for building an e-commerce platform with a user-friendly interface.

### Tech Stack
The e-commerce platform is built using the following technologies and libraries:

1. **React** (v18.2.0) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React is the core framework used for creating the frontend of the e-commerce application.

2. **React Router Dom** (v6.15.0) - A library for routing in React applications. It enables navigation between different pages within the application.

3. **Tailwind CSS** (v3.3.3) - A utility-first CSS framework that simplifies the styling and layout of web components. Tailwind CSS is used to ensure a responsive and visually appealing design.

4. **React Icons** (v4.10.1) - A library that provides a collection of customizable, high-quality icons for use in the user interface.

5. **React Hot Toast** (v2.4.1) - A library for displaying toast notifications in React applications. It enhances the user experience by providing feedback for actions such as adding items to the cart.

6. **React Use Cart** (v1.13.0) - A library for managing shopping cart functionality in React applications. It allows users to add and remove items from their cart, view the cart's contents, and proceed to checkout.

7. **@headlessui/react** (v1.7.17) and **@heroicons/react** (v2.0.18) - These libraries provide pre-designed UI components and icons, which can be customized and used to build the user interface.

The project's development environment is configured to support both production and development builds, with the browser compatibility ensured for popular modern browsers.




# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
